# Introduction 
Here we are going to learn more about HTML, so that you can make your Python Website look a bit better. 

## Step One 
We start off with this basic html file 

```` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>About Me</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>

````

This code defines the basic structure of an HTML document, including the ````<!DOCTYPE html>```` declaration, the opening and closing html tags, the head section, and the body section. We've also added a title for the page, "About Me."

## Step Three : Add Content
Add content to your HTML document: You can add content to your HTML document by adding tags within the body section. For an "About Me" page, you might want to start with a heading that says "About Me" and a brief paragraph introducing yourself:

```` html 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>About Me</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hi, my name is [Your Name] and I'm a [Your Profession] based in [Your Location]. I love [Your Interests] and spend my free time [Your Hobbies].</p>
</body>
</html>

````

This will display the text "About Me" as a large heading on your web page, followed by a paragraph introducing yourself.

## Step Four : Add An Image 
Add an image: To make your "About Me" page more personal, you can add a photo of yourself. To do this, you'll need to have an image file of yourself saved on your computer. You can then add the image to your HTML document using the ````<img>```` tag:

```` html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>About Me</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hi, my name is [Your Name] and I'm a [Your Profession] based in [Your Location]. I love [Your Interests] and spend my free time [Your Hobbies].</p>
	<img src="[Your Image File]" alt="[Description of Your Image]">
</body>
</html>

````

Replace [Your Image File] with the file path of your image (e.g. "images/me.jpg"), and replace [Description of Your Image] with a short description of the image (e.g. "A photo of me").

## Step Five : Add Links To Your Page
Add links: If you have any social media profiles or a personal website, you can add links to them in your "About Me" page using the ``<a>`` tag. For example:


```` html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>About Me</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hi, my name is [Your Name] and I'm a [Your Profession] based in [Your Location]. I love [Your Interests] and spend my free time [Your Hobbies].</p>
	<img src="[Your Image File]" alt="[Description of Your Image]">
	<p>Follow me on <a href="[Your Social Media Profile]">[Social Media Platform]</a> or check out my <a href="[Your Personal Website]">personal website</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>

````

Replace [Your Social Media Profile] with the URL of your social media profile (e.g. "https://www.instagram.com/yourusername"), and replace `[Social Media
